# Node.js Learning Project

This repository contains my practice exercises and projects as I learn Node.js from scratch through **Mosh Hamedani's Node.js tutorials**. The focus is on mastering backend development, including creating APIs, routing, working with databases, and implementing authentication.

## About

Iâ€™m following Mosh's step-by-step videos to build a strong foundation in Node.js. Through these exercises, I aim to understand:

- Node.js fundamentals
- Building RESTful APIs with Express.js
- Data validation with Joi
- Connecting to MongoDB using Mongoose
- Authentication and authorization
- Error handling and debugging

Feel free to explore the repository as I document my learning progress. ðŸ˜Š
